here i take string and each string have one box 
not the position og the box is fix
so in string i need to find the position of the box(char) from the String

in java string start from 0 - n-1 
so the position is need to be -1 ;

It's guarantee that each digit of number N
 is greater than 0

char threshholdBoxPosition = N.charAt(position -1);
            int converInt = Character.getNumericValue(threshholdBoxPosition);

            Character.getNumericValue() this method ocnvert char to numeric

here i take string and each string have one box 
not the position og the box is fix
so in string i need to find the position of the box(char) from the String

in java string start from 0 - n-1 
so the position is need to be -1 ;

It's guarantee that each digit of number N
 is greater than 0

char threshholdBoxPosition = N.charAt(position -1);
but we need the position of input was given from the right position 
for that we will extract the length of the string and make division with the position 
    char threshholdBoxPosition = N.charAt(N.length() - position);
            int converInt = Character.getNumericValue(threshholdBoxPosition);
print(convertInt)
            Character.getNumericValue() this method ocnvert char to numeric

A. Team 

3 friend Petya, Vasya, Tony form a team 
participant usually offered several problems 
they decide if two of them are sure about the solution they will implement the solution 
or else they won't write the solution 

the contest offers 'n' problems. for each problem we know which friend sure about the solution.
now find the number of problems which they will write the solution if two friend are sure and write the solution...


  solution --> 
  twoFriend > 2
  if 1 + 1 + 0 
1. input line contain single integer 'n' (1<= n <= 1000) number of problems
2. each n line contain 'three' integers and each integer is either 1 or 0
3. if first number is equal 1 then Petya is sure about the problem, otherwise he wont sure. and it is to rest of Vasya and Tony 
4. the numbers on the line are separated by spaces.

int countSolution = 0;
for
(input n integer)

input P, V, T as integers 
P = 1, V = 1, T = 0 => 1
P = 0, V = 1, T = 1 => 1
P = 0, V = 0, T = 1 => 0
Solution 1. (p==1 && v==1) || (p==1 && t==1) || (v==1 && t==1)
Solution 2. twoFriendSolution p+v+t >= 2
if twoFriendSolution >= 2
countSolution ++;

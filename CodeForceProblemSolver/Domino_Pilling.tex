rectangular board M * N
unlimited domino pieces 2 * 1 (M * N)
allowed to rotate the pieces -> place as many as dominos pieces as possible

1. dominos cover two squires but
2. no two dominoes overlap
3. dominoes lies entirely inside the M * N board.

--> find the maximum number of dominos, who are placed under those restriction

[Are of Rectangular board - > A = M * N

M = Length, N = Width

Total number of Rectangles (including squires) -> (M * (M + 1) / 2) * (N * (N + 1) / 2)

Total Number of Squares -> âˆ‘ (M - k + 1) * (N - k + 1)
--> k represents the side length of the square (e.g., k=1 for 1x1 squares, k=2 for 2x2 squares, etc.)

when we try to find the total squire of a rectangle then
min(squire-> 1x 1) length of the squire k = 1;
max(squre-> N x N) length of the squire k = N;]


--->
input:
a single line given two integers M and N --> board size in squires

-->
output:
the maximum number of dominoes which can be placed

1. dominos cover two squires
---> find the total squires first

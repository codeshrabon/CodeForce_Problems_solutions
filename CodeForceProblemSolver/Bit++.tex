A. Bit++

variable x
two operations -> 
1. increases ++
2. decreases --
-> A statement is Bit++ is a sequence - one operation and one variable x
      and it can contain one character "+", "-", "x" ...
-> executing a statement means apply one operation 

solution-->
initial x = 0

input =>
first line --> int n
String char = input 
there is a contains() method that check the specific character inside the variables 
if(char.contains("specific_characters"))
next n line contains a statement each - (one operation and one variable x)

--> Each statement contains exactly one operation (++ or --) and
        exactly one variable x (denoted as letter «X»).

Output
Print a single integer — the final value of x.

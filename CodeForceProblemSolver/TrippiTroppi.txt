Concatenation vs. addition of chars

System.out.println(oneCon + twoCon + threeCon);

You’re actually adding ASCII values of the chars, not printing them side by side.
Example: 'a' + 'b' + 'c' = 294 (not "abc").

✅ Fix: Use a string builder or "" + oneCon + twoCon + threeCon.


String one = sc.nextLine();
String two = sc.nextLine();
String three = sc.nextLine();
This makes the program expect 3 separate lines per test case, while the problem only provides 1 line per test case.

read the whole line once, then split it into 3 words.
String one = sc.next();
String two = sc.next();
String three = sc.next();

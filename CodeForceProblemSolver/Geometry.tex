first -> use the properties of the circle and the rectangle to determine their dimensions and the triangles vertices 

there given
-> A height 
-> B width 

given ---> B=2A

the rectangle
width -> B -> 2A
length -> A
area of rectangle -> 2A * A (base * height) --> 2A^2

for circle we know are of circle -> pai * r^2
when both circles are identical - > 
width(height) -> 2r

rectangle Area -> width(height) A -> 2r --> r = A/2.
if 2 circle fit inside the rectangle -> A = 2r

Area of circle -> from circle are we know A = pai * r^2

so the read area = Area of rectangle - area of circle 








Triangle formula -> .5 * base * height

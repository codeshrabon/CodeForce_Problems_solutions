In Main class 
the problem statement was entering 'n' number of word form the user 
after that chect if the words are more then 10 words or not if the words are more then 10 then 
print will be as the fLatter + word.length + lLatter

now here is catch while we try to take one character from the word we use char data type 
and while printing it with "fLatter + word.length + lLatter" 

we are actually printing it as ASCII format which is not we want 
to prevent it we use "" cotation ;

now while we measure the length of the word which is more then 10 
the fLatter and lLatter are counted 
so, the middle words are now less then 2 and we need to keep it mind


using for loop to count how many word will be enterd from the user 
when its done we enter to if statement and if it is true 
we print (fLatter + "" + (word.length - 2) + "" + lLatter);

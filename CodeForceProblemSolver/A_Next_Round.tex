contestant score(positive score) >= k-th place --> next round 

total participants 'n' ; which is n >= k

find how many participants will go to next round 

input ---> 

first line two integer n, k 
second line n score and got position in i-th place and given sequence is non-increasing

input participants n , 
score in array [] 
position k 
if array[i] >= k 
 
but to take the input the score of n-th participants 
we need array int 

int[] score = new int[n]
use for loop to give the score from the user 
Input loop-> Should be i < n
for (i=0; i< n ;i++){
    score[i] = sc.nextInt();
}

to count how many participants are allowed 
int count=0
check the score with the postion 
Counting loop -> you need to check all n participants.
✅ Should also be i < n.
for (condition)
if score[i] >= k 

--> score[k-1] as the threshold 
because the cut-off depends on the 
actual scores and the value of k.

use of this means arrya count from 0 - (n-1)
-> Java arrays are 0-based 
→ valid indices are 0 to n-1.
count++;

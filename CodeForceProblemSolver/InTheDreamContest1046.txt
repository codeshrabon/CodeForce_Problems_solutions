we use 

int firstHalfRiOI = a;
int firstHalfKDOI = b;

int secondHalfRiOI = c - a; difference between first and second half 
int secondHalfKDOI = d - b;

then we use boolean to see if our logic is ok

we use Math.max and Math.min 

to formulate 

Math.max() <= 2 * Math.min() + 2

it ensure each half time the goal has no been done 3 consicutive time 

firstHalfRiOI = 3, firstHalfKDOI = 2
Math.max = 3
Math.min = 2
Check: 3 <= 2*2 + 2 → 3 <= 6 ✔

Possible sequence: R K R K R → no 3 consecutive goals
